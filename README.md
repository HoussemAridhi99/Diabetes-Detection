# 🧠 Machine Learning Project – Classification/Regression Analysis

This project is a Machine Learning analysis performed in a Jupyter Notebook, covering data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. The project was exported as an HTML file for easy sharing and visualization.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `Projet ML.ipynb` – Main notebook containing all the code (original source)
- `Projet ML.html` – HTML version of the notebook for easier viewing
- `data/` – Folder for any CSV or data files (not included here)

## 🚀 Features

- Data Cleaning and Exploration
- Model Selection and Training (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Trees)
- Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, etc.)
- Visualizations and Graphs for Analysis
- Exportable and sharable HTML output


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Models Used

The project includes experiments with different machine learning algorithms like:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Decision Trees
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Random Forests

Each model is evaluated and compared using:
- Accuracy
- Precision/Recall
- ROC/AUC
- Cross-validation

## 📈 Results

The best-performing model was chosen based on evaluation metrics. Visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC curves were included for interpretability.
